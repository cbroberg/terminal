If you’re getting “Permission denied” errors, it’s likely because Time Machine files are protected by the macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) or have strict permissions. Here’s a way to address this issue:

	1.	Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP):
	•	Restart your Mac and hold down Command + R to boot into Recovery Mode.
	•	Once in Recovery Mode, open Utilities > Terminal.
	•	Type this command to disable SIP:

csrutil disable

	•	Press Enter, then restart your Mac.

	2.	Change Permissions Manually:
	•	Open Terminal.
	•	Run the following command to change the permissions of the Backups.backupdb folder:

sudo chmod -R 755 /Volumes/NetworkDrive/Backups.backupdb

	•	This should allow you to delete the folder afterward.

	3.	Try the Delete Command Again:
	•	After adjusting permissions, retry the delete command:

sudo rm -rf /Volumes/NetworkDrive/Backups.backupdb

	4.	Re-enable SIP (recommended):
	•	Once the deletion is complete, it’s a good idea to re-enable SIP.
	•	Boot back into Recovery Mode, open Terminal again, and run:

csrutil enable

	•	Restart your Mac.
